				<h1>Who I Am</h1>
				<p>
					My name is Patricia Easton. I am married to Gary Easton. I live in Post Falls, Idaho, and I have a Master's in Science of Psychology. I went to University of Idaho for my first two years, and I got my Master's at Eastern Washington University. I started my own practice in Coeur D'Alene, Idaho.
					In the late 1960's, early 1970's, I was a nurse and LVN (Licenced Vocational Nurse) in California. I took time from my career to raise my beautiful children for 24 years. Since then, I went to NIC and LCSC to obtain my bachelor's degree in solcial work. I worked out at the community, then in 2003/2004, I went to EWU, I got my Master's Degree in Social Work.
					I have been in private practice for the past few years.
