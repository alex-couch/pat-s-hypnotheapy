					"I would highly recommend Patricia Easton as a therapist.  I have seen her for a number of years and she has helped keep my depression and anxiety at bay.  She gave me coping skills to deal with what comes up in my life and helped keep me on an even keel mood wise.  I would recommend her to anyone who needs a good, stable therapist to guide them along in life.  Patricia can help you with goals and how to meet them, eating and smoking issues or just lend an ear when you feel like you need one.  I am pleased to be able to give her a vote of confidence."
