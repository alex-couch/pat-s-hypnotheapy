				<p style="font-size: 25px">
					My name is Patricia Jean Easton<sup>MSW, LCSW, CHT, LLC</sup>. In the late 1960's, early 1970's, I was a nurse and LVN (Licenced Vocational Nurse) in California. I took time from my career to raise my beautiful children for 20+ years. Since then, I went to NIC and LCSC to obtain my bachelor's degree in social work. I worked out at the community, then in 2003/2004, I went to EWU, I got my Master's Degree in Social Work.
					I have been in private practice for the past few years.
